# Banter

I'd like to be able to implement a new http server solution built from the ground up specifically for static sites. No more express/connect bloat/crap, no more confusing middleware, just go back to the basics. If we could somehow create a new system with simple yet custom features connected to a vinyl filesystem (allowing the source to come from anywhere whether it be a local filesystem, S3, etc.), it could be a game changer for static servers. Express was built with MVC in mind, and a static server doesn't need MVC.
